# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

An artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to automatically identify and categorize diabetic retinopathy using fundus images.
The proposed model incorporates EfficientNetB3 for image classification, facilitating precise identification of retinopathy cases in diabetic patients. The model classifies fundus images into two primary categories: non-diabetic and diabetic. Additionally, for diabetic cases, the model further differentiates severity into mild, moderate, and severe stages, reflecting various phases of the disease.
